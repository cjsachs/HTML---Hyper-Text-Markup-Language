1. Introduction to HTML

- What is HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage.
CSS styles the appearance of the webpage.
JavaScript adds interactivity.

- Show a live example of a basic webpage (just HTML), and another example of a styled webpage (HTML + CSS), to illustrate the difference.



2. HTML Document Structure

<!DOCTYPE html> declaration
<html>: The root element
<head>: Metadata section (elements like <title>, <meta>, <link>)
<body>: The visible content of the webpage

Every HTML document begins with <!DOCTYPE html>.
The <head> contains information that doesn't appear on the page but helps browsers render the content.
The <body> contains all the visible content of the page (text, images, links, etc.).

- Create a simple HTML document structure together. Start with an empty index.html file and walk through adding boilerplate.



3. Basic HTML Elements
Most common HTML elements used to structure content.

Headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.): Headings help organize content by hierarchy.
Paragraphs (<p>): Paragraphs are used for blocks of text.
Links (<a>): Links allow users to navigate between pages.
Lists (<ul>, <li>, <ol>): Lists are useful for organizing items.
Images (<img>): Images make webpages more engaging.


- Add a few elements to our existing HTML file.
- Block elements vs Inline elements
